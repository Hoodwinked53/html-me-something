                        Every few years, my friends and I like to plan a big trip where we travel somewhere in the world that most of us have not visited for an opportunity to create memories with each other, where we get to experience unique cultures, cuisines, and places/events. We've done Japan in the past, as well as France & Mexico. In early 2019 when we decided where our next destination spot should be, I threw out hopping around Eastern Europe. Not only would it be an opportunity to see my family, whom mostly live in Poland and were celebrating my brother's wedding, but also to celebrate Oktoberfest in Munich. This had been a bucket list item for me for years, and it's one of those events where I feel it's better to do while you're a bit younger. So fast forward a couple months and we've landed in Munic to begin our hopping around Eastern Europe!

                        We started our trip in Munich right on the second day that Oktoberfest was starting. While this part of the trip wasn't so much for sight seeing, as much as just enjoying and taking in the sights and sounds of Oktoberfest, we still spent the first day exploring Munich, and of course getting some authentic lederhosen to be a part of the experience. In the park where they hold Oktoberfest, there are 15+ different tents, all having a different theme and vibe. Each one corresponds to a different brewery in Germany. In the 3 days we were there we explored as many as we could and were more than ready to move on to the next city after 3 days of meeting new friends from all over the world, and possibly cheersing one too many times!

                        Now this was my 2nd time coming to Prague, but honestly, that just made more excited to come back and see more of what is possibly the architecturally cool city I've been to in the world. The sprawling, medieval-looking streets, with no shortage of different shops, bars, and restaurants down every winding alley had my friends and I excited to explore. We went to the Prague Castle, which is the largest castle in the world and a church that is still under construction after 100's of years. At night, Prague has some of the largest nightclubs in Europe and we jumped around and explored a few of them. One of these was completely underground, with small bars on the bottom floor that had little stairwells that led up to massive dance floors. There were multiple bars and multiple dance floors in what seemed like a city of a nightclub.

                        I describe Poland as my home away from home. Most of my family lives over there and I love having the opportunity to go visit them every few years. This time, however, was extra special, as I was taking my friends to see what's possibly my favorite cozy medieval city in the world, as well as introducing them to my family as we celebrated my brother's wedding in Europe for all the family that couldn't attend in the states. We ate traditional Polish food, celebrated playing some Polish wedding games, and drank bottles of vodka that seemed endless. In Poland, there typically isn't served beer at weddings, and there is just a constant feed of frozen bottles of vodka thrown on the table the second the last is finished. Everyone had a blast and after a day or two of sightseeing Krakow and taking my friends to my favorite places, we were off to the next city.

                        Vienna is one of the cleanest cities I've ever seen, and I'm glad that our first time exploring was after it got dark. Honestly, one of the best experiences of this whole trip was that first night walking around the city and taking it all in. I've never seen so many elaborate monuments and buildings within such a close proximity of each other that were all so intricate and special in their own way. Even their parliament building was this massive imposing structure that molded ancient Roman and modern design. It was truly a sight to see! This part of the trip was more of a relaxing one and we didn't do anything too crazy. We ate good food and saw beautiful sights and that was perfect! One of the food highlights was eating the biggest pork schnitzel I've ever seen at a very old restaurant Mark Twain once really liked.

                        This is one city I would love to come back to some day. While the city itself wasn't as beautiful or interesting as some of our other stops, I really fell in love with the people, culture, and overall candor of the city. I loved the main city squares where they had turned old bombed out WWII buildings into bars/restaurants called ruin bars. How they turned destruction into something so charming is beyond me, and the ambience with the music and people was nice and pleasant. We did a river tour as well to give us a bit of background of the 2 cities that were merged into one (Buda and Pest). After all these amazing cities though, we were exhausted and couldn't get home sooner to sleep in our own beds and be back to familiarity that comes with home!
