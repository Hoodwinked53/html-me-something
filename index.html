                        Every few years, my friends and I like to plan a big trip where we travel somewhere in the world that most of us have not visited for an opportunity to create memories with each other, where we get to experience unique cultures, cuisines, and places/events. We've done Japan in the past, as well as France & Mexico. In early 2019 when we decided where our next destination spot should be, I threw out hopping around Eastern Europe. Not only would it be an opportunity to see my family, whom mostly live in Poland and were celebrating my brother's wedding, but also to celebrate Oktoberfest in Munich. This had been a bucket list item for me for years, and it's one of those events where I feel it's better to do while you're a bit younger. So fast forward a couple months and we've landed in Munic to begin our hopping around Eastern Europe!
